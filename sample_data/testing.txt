    "title": "Srinivasa Ramanujan",
    "summary": "Srinivasa Ramanujan was an Indian mathematician known for his extraordinary mathematical insights and contributions, despite a lack of formal training. He attributed his acumen to his family goddess and often expressed a divine connection to mathematics. His extensive notebooks, filled with theorems and results, have profoundly influenced subsequent mathematical research.",
