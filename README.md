## 🧪 Development & Testing
Run backend only:
```bash
docker-compose run backend
```
Run frontend (with hot reload):
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```
Check database:
```bash
docker exec -it <mysql_container_id> mysql -u root -p
```

## ⚙️ Docker Configuration Summary
| Service	| Container Port |	Host Port |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| Frontend	| 5173	| 5173 |
| Backend |	8000	| 8000 |
| MySQL |	3306	| 3310 |

## Services:
**db** → MySQL with persistent volume db_data

**backend** → FastAPI + Gemini quiz service

**frontend** → React app served via Vite

## Bonus Points

- "Take Quiz" mode with user scoring.
- URL validation and preview (auto-fetch article title before processing).
- Store scraped raw HTML in database for reference.
- Caching to prevent duplicate scraping of the same URL.
- Section-wise question grouping in UI.

## ❓ Troubleshooting
Issue	Cause	Fix
Frontend not loading	Vite not listening on 0.0.0.0	Update Dockerfile to expose host
CORS error	API origin mismatch	Allow CORS in FastAPI and update VITE_API_BASE_URL
MySQL connection error	Wrong host in DATABASE_URL	Use db (not localhost) in the connection string

### ☁️ Deploying on Render (Optional)
Deploy backend as a Docker service (choose backend/ directory).

Deploy frontend as a Static Site or Docker app (choose frontend/).

Use Render’s Managed MySQL and update your DATABASE_URL.

Update .env files and redeploy both services.
